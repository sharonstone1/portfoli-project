# THIS IS A SIMPLE RESUME WITH BOOTSTRAP 5

### The Purpose of this Project

The project was designed to showcase the features of Bootstrap 5, building on the Bootstrap 4 tutorial available on Udemy.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate my knowledge of Bootstrap 5 and how we can create small projects, such as a resume, without needing to know other programming languages.

As a beginner in programming, it is useful to learn HTML, CSS, and their frameworks. It’s also enjoyable to build small projects using these tools.

I would not recommend the Udemy course on Bootstrap 4 for beginners who do not have some prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or jQuery. Additionally, it is essential to read the Bootstrap documentation before starting the course.

Why? Because some of the tutorial code contains errors and can result in many bugs if you simply copy and paste or follow the instructor’s instructions exactly as presented.

I can admit that I struggled a bit at first, but thanks to Stack Overflow, I managed to fix the bugs, as I was new to the Bootstrap CSS framework.
